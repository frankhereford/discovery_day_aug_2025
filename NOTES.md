# Notes and thoughts

- Interested in what it uses for metadata state, is there a analog to `.git`?
  - How does this work in conjunction with the `git`
    - A: side by side, with a lot of `npm` like inspirations
      - `pyproject.toml` in the place of a `package.json`
      - `.python-version` in the place of `.nvmrc`

## Goals

- Stand up a local Jupyter Notebook and manage using additional libraries
  - Try not to mix technologies (`pip` and `uv`)

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

- Found all my pre-installed versions of python
